## About

**formform** is a modular JavaScript library all about the 4-valued logic of cognition first introduced 2017 by Ralf Peyn in [uFORM iFORM](https://uformiform.info/). The library in its core has the purpose of calculating with all the FORMs introduced in the book and is meant to be extended with more specialized modules for different tasks like FORM representation, algebra, visualization or simulation and analysis using CAs.

Please note that this is still very much work in progress. The library is currently in the process of restructuring and you may want to wait for a more stable release if you intent to use it. I am not a professional developer and this is just my part-time hobby. Since I still have much to learn and this is my first real library, I'll be very thankful for any advice.


## History

This library has become my personal project since I first began studying [uFORM iFORM](https://uformiform.info/). Ralfs SelFis *(visual interpretation of a part system from the selfreferential system of the FORM)* inspired me to develop my own [cellular automaton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_automaton) in the programming environment [Processing](https://processing.org/) for a deeper unterstanding of those systems. 

Working with lookup tables for the calculations at first was okay, but I needed more flexibility, so I began working on some functions to calculate with all four values and in 2018 I was finally able to implement an algorithm to calculate all self-equivalent re-entry FORMs that were described in the book.

I saw that there was more potential in this little collection of functions, so I began working on a JavaScript library to elaborate my ideas which gradually became *formform*. In the near future I will also rewrite my CA for SelFis as well as for the recently introduced [MindFORMs](https://carl-auer-akademie.com/blogs/systemzeit/2019/02/13/how-does-system-function-operate-5-mindforms/) in JavaScript and integrate them into my formform modules.
